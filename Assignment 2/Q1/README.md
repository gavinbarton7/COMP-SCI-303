# Introduction
This program allows you to create and modify a singly linked list with any of the following data types: integers, floats, strings, or booleans. The 11 functions of the program work the same regardless of which data type you choose, with the one exception being that the program will only accept inputs of the data type you chose at the beginning of the program when you try to add or look for values to the linked list, so when using the functions to add a value to the front, add a value to the back, add a value at a given index, or look for a value in the linked list, so remember to input a value of the type you selected at the beginning of the program when asked which value you would like to add to the linked list. The prompt will specify whether you should enter an "integer", "float", "string", or "boolean" to help you remember which data type you are using.

NOTE: Any time the program outputs "Press Enter to Continue", you must press the enter key to continue in the program

When you first open the program, it will look like this:

If you enter a value outside the range of 1 and 4, you will get a message saying this:

You will continuously receive the same message until the value you input is between 1 and 4.

## Functions
For the purpose of these instructions, I will be using integers for my Singly Linked List. However, the program will have the same 11 functions with the same prompts and outputs, with the one exception being the part of the prompt where it specifies the data type for the linked list.

After you select the data type you would like to use, the program will output this:

### 1. Add value to the front
When you select this function, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05254453-40db-44d8-a594-69163b5bc867)

NOTE: The word "integer" will be replaced with "float", "string" or "boolean value (0 for false, 1 for true)" if you are using a different data type for your linked list.

Enter an integer value into the prompt. And then you will be returned to the Main Menu

### 2. Add value to the back
When you select this function, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4656b3ef-8e34-4033-bee4-057677d79d25)

NOTE: The word "integer" will be replaced with "float", "string" or "boolean value (0 for false, 1 for true)" if you are using a different data type for your linked list.

Enter an integer value into the prompt. And then you will be returned to the Main Menu

### 3. Remove value from the front
When you select this function, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19ef08e2-03b6-47a0-b455-8c0361b5981b)

Since this function requires no input, you will be immediately returned to the main menu of the program

### 4. Remove value from the back
When you select this function, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f59d6ed3-d431-4472-b6c8-57e7716ba6dd)

Since this function requires no input, you will be immediately returned to the main menu of the program

### 5. Obtain value at the front
If you select this function and there are no values in the linked list, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61fd81b3-4eb7-459b-b662-3360e556a499)

However, if there is at least one value in the linked list, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/957e41a0-95c8-4c11-8a6c-aeb7ecc33faf)
NOTE: The value at the end will be whichever value is at the front of the linked list

### 6. Obtain value at the back
If you select this function and there are no values in the linked list, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e325b3a-93c2-4355-b906-895149634381)

However, if there is at least one value in the linked list, this is what it will display:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1bdefa9-dc90-465c-b83b-75d56226ffa4)
NOTE: The value at the end will be whichever value is at the back of the linked list

### 7. Check to see if the linked list is empty
This is what the program will display if the linked list is not empty

This is what the program will display if the linked list is empty
