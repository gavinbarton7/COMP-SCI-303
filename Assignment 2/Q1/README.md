# Introduction
This program allows you to create and modify a singly linked list with any of the following data types: integers, floats, strings, or booleans. The 11 functions of the program work the same regardless of which data type you choose, with the one exception being that the program will only accept inputs of the data type you chose at the beginning of the program when you try to add or look for values to the linked list, so when using the functions to add a value to the front, add a value to the back, add a value at a given index, or look for a value in the linked list, so remember to input a value of the type you selected at the beginning of the program when asked which value you would like to add to the linked list. The prompt will specify whether you should enter a "integer", "float", "string", or "boolean" to help you remember which data type you are using.
