# Introduction
This program allows you to create and modify a singly linked list with any of the following data types: integers, floats, strings, or booleans. The 11 functions of the program work the same regardless of which data type you choose, with the one exception being that the program will only accept inputs of the data type you chose at the beginning of the program when you try to add or look for values to the linked list, so when using the functions to add a value to the front, add a value to the back, add a value at a given index, or look for a value in the linked list, so remember to input a value of the type you selected at the beginning of the program when asked which value you would like to add to the linked list. The prompt will specify whether you should enter an "integer", "float", "string", or "boolean" to help you remember which data type you are using.

When you first open the program, it will look like this:

## Functions
For the purpose of these instructions, I will be using integers for my Singly Linked List. However, the program will have the same 11 functions with the same exact prompts and outputs, with the one exception being the part of the prompt where it specifies the data type for the linked list.

### Add value to the front
