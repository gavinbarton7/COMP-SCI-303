# Array modifier program

This program reads 100 integer values from the file "A1input.txt" into an array, and allows you to modify the array by adding, removing, or replacing values in it. It also allows you to find out whether a specific integer value is in the array by searching through the array and providing you with the index where the integer is located.

## Read this section before going to the instructions for running the code

Warning: Whenever this program asks you for input, only input integer values. If you input anything besides an integer value at any point in this program, you will get an error message, and you will have to restart from the beginning at the program's main menu.

The three lines between the "Enter a choice 1-6: one" and "Press Enter to Continue" are the error messages. Although this screenshot depicts the error message being displayed after the user enters their choice in the main menu, you will get the same exact three-line error message any time you enter a letter, word, or non-numerical value when asked for input in this program.

## Instructions for running the code: 

### Main menu

When you first open the program, it should look like this:

To continue, you must enter a value between 1 and 5 based on which of the 5 functions you would like to use or enter 6 to exit the program. If you enter a value outside of the range of 1-6, this will happen:

You must then enter a value between 1 and 6 into the next prompt, otherwise, this will occur:

You will continue to receive the same prompt infinitely until you enter a value that is between 1 and 6.

### Function 1: Check to see if the array contains a specific value

After you select the function in the main menu, this will prompt will pop up:

You must then enter an integer value into the prompt, if the integer you enter is in the array, you will get an output telling you which index it is at, such as this:
