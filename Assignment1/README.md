# Array modifier program

This program reads 100 integer values from the file "A1input.txt" into an array, and allows you to modify the array by adding, removing, or replacing values in it. It also allows you to find out whether a specific integer value is in the array by searching through the array and providing you with the index where the integer is located at.

## Read this section before going to the instructions for running the code

Warning: Whenever this program asks you for input, only input integer values. If you input anything besides an integer value at any point in this program, you will get an error message, and you will have to restart from the beginning at the program's main menu.

The three lines between the "Enter a choice 1-6: one" and "Press Enter to Continue" are the error message. Although this screenshot depicts the error message being displayed after the user enters their choice in the main menu, you will get the same exact three-line error message any time you enter a letter, word, or non-numerical value when asked for input in this program.
