# Array modifier program

This program reads 100 integer values from the file "A1input.txt" into an array, and allows you to modify the array by adding, removing, or replacing values in it. It also allows you to find out whether a specific integer value is in the array by searching through the array and providing you with the index that the integer is located with.

WARNING: Whenever this program asks you for input, only input integer values. If you input anything besides an integer value at any point in this program, you will get an error message, and you will have to restart from the beginning at the program's main menu. See the screenshot for an example of what this error message should look like.
